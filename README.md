# LinearAlgebra
Implementation of matrices and other linear algebra functionalities.

This library is intended for me to practice using templates in C++ and to improve my linear algebra skills

Currently includes functionality for:
- Matrices (addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication)
- Echelon Form
- Reduced Echelon Form
- Determinant of an nxn matrix
